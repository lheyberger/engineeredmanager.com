This is probably the place that should host a full auto-biography, but I don't feel old or important enough to write one.

However, this weblog is a collection of thoughts or technical notes about what I love the most (besides my wife):

* [programming](./archives.html#programming)
* [gaming](./archives.html#gaming)
* [photography](./archives.html#photography)

If you're curious to know how this website is done under the hood you will find more details [here](./underthehood.html).

If you still want to read a few details about my work, it's right after the break.

# Into the work world

I started my career at [MKO Games](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MKO_Games), a video game company that, strangely enough, never really had a real website, by coding a few gameplay prototypes for _what should have been_ a next generation online 3D casino game.

Then I integrated the tools development team and participated in developing the software that was used for all our game design and game prototyping needs. The tool was built in C# / WinForms, with a splash of C++ CLI for the bindings with the [engine](http://www.gamebryo.com/).

This tool was used on the production of _what should have been_ a game based on the universe of [Skyland](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyland) (the production was eventually canceled after a few years) and _what should have been_ a game base on the story of the [Little Prince](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince) (this project was also canceled after a few years).

After having canceled all the main projects, the company was put under administration and forced to lay off two-thirds of the employees. That's when I started to work on an archery game, [SplitApple](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SplitApple), and a darts throwing game, [T-80 Darts](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/T-80_Darts), both for iOS. Those games were developed using an in-house C++ engine called O2 and entirely written using the LUA bindings.

Those were the best years at MKO Games. We worked hard, we invented things to solve the issues we had, and at the end, it worked pretty well. We also played a lot of Starcraft II which provided endless discussions during the coffee breaks.

But this didn't last very long: the company definitely closed in march 2012 during the development of _what should have been_ (notice the patterns?) a game based on the animated series about [Le Petit Nicolas](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_petit_Nicolas).

# Welcome to the real world

I then the video games' world to work at [DxO Labs](http://dxo.com), a company that deals with image quality.

I've been part of the team that develops the Windows version of [Optics Pro](http://www.dxo.com/intl/photography/dxo-optics-pro), a software that enhances the quality of your digital pictures, whether they were taken with the latest pro camera in town or with a more affordable camera or smartphone. The software is built in C# / WPF and once again a splash of C++ CLI for the bindings with the internal image correction engine.

In addition to everything else, I designed multiple key parts like the background threading and synchronization, the caching mechanism and the export (to facebook, lightroom, image applications or disk) plug-in system.

# That sounds good

After having participated to the development and the releases of OpticsPro 8, 9 and 10, I've left the company to work at [Deezer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deezer)'s Windows related clients ([Windows phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/deezer/abf78126-7301-e011-9264-00237de2db9e) and [Windows](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en/app/deezer/e48b595e-b20a-4eb3-968c-c20b2cadaa1e/m/row)).

That's the story so far.
