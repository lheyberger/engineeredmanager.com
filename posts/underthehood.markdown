When I started this website, I asked myself whether or not I should use a classic blog engine like WordPress or something _less brutal_ that would answer my needs without being overkill.

During my researches, I stumbled upon [Dr Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Mr Hyde](http://hyde.github.io/), two static websites generators. The concept really interested me, so I started to do a little bit more digging in this direction. That's when I found [James Hague](http://prog21.dadgum.com/)'s very interesting blog who uses a [similar](http://prog21.dadgum.com/56.html) [approach](http://prog21.dadgum.com/77.html).

I decided to follow the same path: This site is generated by a python script, using a few [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) templates and a set of [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files for the style.

As for the posts, they are written using a mix of [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/) for the header and [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for the content:

	Here comes the content, written in **markdown**

The python script is in charge of generating the [pages](./index.html), the [archives](./archives.html) and an [atom feed](./feed.atom).

I love the process and I really like the simplicity.
