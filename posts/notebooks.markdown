A few months ago, I started to think about how I could improve my creative workflow.
Probably like everybody, I have a lot of ideas going through my head that I loose because I don't write them down in time.

I started to think of a way of fixing that and see what would happen with all those ideas and the first step to stop loosing my ideas was to figure out a way write them down that would work the best for me.

I tried to take a few notes using dedicated applications on my smartphone, but it quickly became very annoying because there were no easy way to review them in an ergonomic and optimized fashion.

That's when I switched to paper.
I used to write things and draw a few doodles mostly at work while trying to find solutions to various problems, but I never really carried something with me to write quick notes on the go.
I wanted to give it a try and bought several notebooks until I found the setup that fulfilled my needs. In a matter of weeks, I became addicted with nice looking pocket sized notebooks.

As to deciding what to write in them, I classified my ideas in 2 categories.

# 1 line ideas

It can be anywhere, anytime.
They usually come as fast as they leave, and if you're not prepared, they're gone forever; so I catch them in a pocket notebook with a flexible cover that I can keep with me all the time.

Writing a 1 line idea in my flexible notebook is a matter of seconds.
Easy and simple.

# 1 page ideas

Those are wandering in your head for hours, day or weeks and writing them somwhere allows your brain to move on something else.

I bought a dedicated pocket notebook with a hard cover and a lot more pages in which I try to follow the pattern **1 page == 1 idea**.
If I need to add details about an idea or if an idea is directly related to another, I simply add a reference to another page.

This is also a very simple way to track the number of ideas I've stored in it.
