		<h1>Going instant</h1>
		<h2>An instant take on photography</h2>
	</header>
	<p>I've always loved photography. It probably comes from my artistic background when I studied fine arts at the university in my previous life (in this life, I studied computer sciences and become a true geek). When MKO Games <a href="./about.html">closed</a>, I joined <a href="http://dxo.com">DxO Labs</a>, a company working on image quality. Everyday at work, I try to enhance the windows version of Optics Pro, a software that does a pretty good job at <em>fixing</em> your images.</p>
<p>It funny to see that one of the things I like the most in photography is so far from what I'm doing in my day job: instant photography.</p>
<h1>Re-introducing the Polaroid 1000</h1>
<p>One day, I've had the chance to find my dad's <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=polaroid+1000&amp;tbm=isch">polaroid 1000</a> camera and since then I've always wanted to make it work and have a few instant polaroids developed with it.</p>
<p>What was nearly impossible a few years ago if you were not one of those crazy lucky guys to have stored your old polaroid films in perfect condition in your freezer became a reality thanks to <a href="http://www.the-impossible-project.com">The Impossible Project</a>.</p>
<p>Those guys managed to produce polaroid films from scratch (you can read the whole story <a href="http://www.the-impossible-project.com/about">here</a>) allowing me to revive this sexy little polaroid 1000 of mine.</p>
<p>It's sure that the film is not cheap at all (count 24 USD for 8 pictures) and that taking a good picture is incredibly difficult in this try-fail-and-try-again world of digital photography, but the reward is so enormous when you manage to take a shot that is well lit, well composed and properly focused that you quickly forget that it cost you 3 USD.</p>
<h1>Diana F+ &amp; Fuji Instax = Instant Lomography</h1>
<p>In the quest of eventually finding a cheaper alternative to the costly polaroid 1000 films, I found that <a href="http://www.lomography.com">Lomography</a> was editing an accessory for the popular Diana F+ camera that allowed it to take instant pictures using Fuji Instax films.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=diana+instant+back&amp;tbm=isch">end result</a> is pretty <em>unexpected</em> but it has a killer look, and when you master it, you can take pretty awesome shots.</p>
<p>It has an advantage over the Polaroid 1000 camera, that you can control the aperture, the focus and the exposure time which allows you to do pretty cool things.</p>
<p>The main differences concern both the size of the shots (Fuji Instax are credit-card size while Polaroid 1000 are almost two times bigger) and the colors which are pretty different between the two films.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I love so much those two cameras than I can't travel without them. I usually bring them in my bag as well as 1 film pack for the Polaroid 1000 and 2 or 3 film packs of Fuji Instax in addition to my <em>classic</em> digital camera.</p>
