		<h1>Becoming a notebook geek</h1>
		<h2>Because sometimes, a real notebook in a real pocket, is more comfortable</h2>
	</header>
	<p>A few months ago, I started to think about how I could improve my creative workflow.
Probably like everybody, I have a lot of ideas going through my head that I loose because I don't write them down in time.</p>
<p>I started to think of a way of fixing that and see what would happen with all those ideas and the first step to stop loosing my ideas was to figure out a way write them down that would work the best for me.</p>
<p>I tried to take a few notes using dedicated applications on my smartphone, but it quickly became very annoying because there were no easy way to review them in an ergonomic and optimized fashion.</p>
<p>That's when I switched to paper.
I used to write things and draw a few doodles mostly at work while trying to find solutions to various problems, but I never really carried something with me to write quick notes on the go.
I wanted to give it a try and bought several notebooks until I found the setup that fulfilled my needs. In a matter of weeks, I became addicted with nice looking pocket sized notebooks.</p>
<p>As to deciding what to write in them, I classified my ideas in 2 categories.</p>
<h1>1 line ideas</h1>
<p>It can be anywhere, anytime.
They usually come as fast as they leave, and if you're not prepared, they're gone forever; so I catch them in a pocket notebook with a flexible cover that I can keep with me all the time.</p>
<p>Writing a 1 line idea in my flexible notebook is a matter of seconds.
Easy and simple.</p>
<h1>1 page ideas</h1>
<p>Those are wandering in your head for hours, day or weeks and writing them somwhere allows your brain to move on something else.</p>
<p>I bought a dedicated pocket notebook with a hard cover and a lot more pages in which I try to follow the pattern <strong>1 page == 1 idea</strong>.
If I need to add details about an idea or if an idea is directly related to another, I simply add a reference to another page.</p>
<p>This is also a very simple way to track the number of ideas I've stored in it.</p>
